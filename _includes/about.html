  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        As a Senior Manager in Software Development with over 10 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance systems that solve complex real-world challenges. My expertise lies in leading cross-functional teams, driving innovation, and delivering solutions that significantly impact product success.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thrive in end-to-end product development and am equally comfortable contributing to backend architecture, frontend development, mobile apps, deployment, planning, and customer discussions. My ability to mentor and build high-performing teams has been key to delivering impactful results.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my key areas of focus has been Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), where I’ve been working on optimizing algorithms and improving system performance to enable better coordination between autonomous agents. This has been a significant part of my recent projects, including enhancing navigation performance at GreyOrange.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my career, I have led the development of several high-profile projects, including Navigation, System Platform, Ranger MoveSmart, the Cross Belt Sorter, and a Pet’s Hotel Management System. I’ve also been instrumental in migrating a popular job portal to a modern web 2.0 architecture.
