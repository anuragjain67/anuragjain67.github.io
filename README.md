# Technologies
1. Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This website is completely static
   and I use basic HTML or Markdown for everything.
2. Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using the 
   [GitHub Pages Gem](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
   and only Jekyll plugins that are 
   [available on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/).

See the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
