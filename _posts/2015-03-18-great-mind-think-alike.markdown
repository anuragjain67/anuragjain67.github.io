excerpt: I really don't like the quote...
---

I really **don't like** the quote. If you believe so, argue with me on following questions:

* Can't two great mind think different ?

* What if fool and great mind are thinking alike **coincidentally** ? [[Reference](http://bluejeans.com/blog/where-great-minds-meet)] 

* What if both are fool and thinking alike ?[[Reference](http://bluejeans.com/blog/where-great-minds-meet)]

**Tell me**,

* Would Wilbur and Orville Wright have ever gotten that plane off the ground without their collective brainpower, inventiveness and determination? [Reference]

* Would Thomas Edison have ever seen his light bulb reach the masses without the business guidance and investment of J.P. Morgan? [Reference]

Comment on "great minds think alike" by philosopher and revolutionary, **Thomas Paine**:

> **"I do not believe that any two men, on what are called doctrinal points, think alike who think at all. It is only those who have not thought that appear to agree."**

Really, If "great mind think alike" is true then we **didn't able to innovate** so much things in the world.

So, If you are using this quote then use full quote,

**"Great mind thinks alike, Fools seldom differ" ;-)**
