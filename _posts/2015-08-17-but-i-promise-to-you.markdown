## Preface
I think, I was in B.Tech IT 4th semester at IIIT-Allahabad. And it was Promise Day and Heart of poet said write something on it so I did. Now I am publishing it.

## But I Promise to you ...

{% highlight yaml %}
I can't hate you,
Becoz you are my love

But I promise to you that,
In every instant of my life, I will love you.
 
I can't propose you,
Becoz you love the other one
 
But I promise to you that,
In every instant of my dream, I will propose you.
 
I can't talk to you,
Becoz you talk to other one
 
But I promise to you that,
In every instant of my own world, I will talk to you.
 
I can't see you,
Becoz you found no where
 
But I promise to you that,
In every instant of my way, I will see you.
 
I can't touch you,
Becoz you are far from my reach
 
But I promise to you that
In every instant of my life, my heart will touch you.
 
I cant hate you ...
