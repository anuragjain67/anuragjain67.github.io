Watched [Dangal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5074352/) and Interview of [Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Huhzks6drY) . I learned so many things and I want to record that. 

* Always Be Positive, believe in yourself (Tu khub par yakeen kar).
* Hope - You should dream about your goal in day and night.
* Kuch pane ki iccha - If you want to achieve something, think on it and work. You will get it.
* Learn from every single person - It’s good to listen to other person and learn from him.
* Work every day towards the dream.
* Don’t waste your time - Time is precious, learn every day
* Set examples - You should really work towards the dream and set an example.
* There are so many person and negative thoughts,  who will try to stop you towards getting your goal, leave that.
* Become a leader - Give credits to others. Appreciate others.
* Work with your junior, get them up to your level.
* Don’t think you can’t achieve that, work towards that you must achieve.
* Just focus!
* Take your own decisions.
* There are so many persons you don’t like, learn their good quality and ignore.
